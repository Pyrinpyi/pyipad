// MsgPing implements the Message interface and represents a pyrin ping
// message.
//
// For versions BIP0031Version and earlier, it is used primarily to confirm
// that a connection is still valid. A transmission error is typically
// interpreted as a closed connection and that the peer should be removed.
// For versions AFTER BIP0031Version it contains an identifier which can be
// returned in the pong message to determine network timing.
//
// The payload for this message just consists of a nonce used for identifying
// it later.
